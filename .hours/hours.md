## QUESTIONS for ATTIE

> Where do we want the "Learn More" button to go?
> Is there a standard Jackrabbit link I can send people to from the classes section (One that wouldn't need updating every time a session changed/ended)?
> You mentioned wanting a "Parent Portal" what would you like to put in there?
> Do you have any announcements you'd like to make/do we still want this page?
> Do you have a favorite photo to use for each class section?
> Do you want pricing anywhere?
> Are there other pages you'd like and what would you like on them?
> Do you have a schedule for the fall you'd like posted outside of Jackrabbit?
> Do you have a YT channel?
