Coaches bio 
 Head Coach: Attie Doak


My love for gymnastics started at seven years old, I was determined to teach myself with the help from an amazing neighbor. The greatest gift for my 9th birthday was my mom signing me up for a gymnastics class and I was hooked! 



I was a gymnast until 17 when I discovered my love for teaching others gymnastics. I‚Äôve never looked back, teaching others gymnastics quickly became my passion. 



Teaching came pretty natural, I‚Äôve always enjoyed being the 3rd of eight children who also homeschooled. So teaching others has also been an important part of my life as long as I can remember. 



I started as a Junior Coach at 12 years old helping as many classes as I could. At 16, I became a coach of our competition team. 



At 18, I took on head coaching responsibilities for our competition team, including teaching routines, cleaning routines, travel, and being their cheerleader for every win or loss which was a valuable learning experience.



I‚Äôve taught all ages from 18 months to 18 years both girls and boys. I‚Äôve also done  cheer clinics and love working with Cheerleaders to help improve flexibility, stunts and more. 



I find that teaching little gymnasts self confidence and that hard work, practice and discipline will help them develop the skills necessary for any challenge they face as they become young adults. Watching their confidence, work ethic and skills grow is what makes me love teaching gymnastics more and more everyday. I can‚Äôt wait to teach and develop your little gymnast at Double Dutch Gymnastics!

Please encourage your children to come to class with positive attitudes. We will also encourage them to lift each other up in the sport of gymnastics. In the gym there will be no gossip, whispering or cliques! We will always work to have positive things to say to each other. Setting a good example to those who are around you! You never know who is watching and repeating behaviors. There will be NO CELL PHONES or cell phone use by students during class. Always have a positive word for those around you.
