            <p>
                Thank you all for being a part of Double Dutch Gymnastics! We are excited for the year and what it will bring. This is a dream come true for me and my staff, that being said I’d like to communicate some expectations I have for you and your children.
            </p>
            <strong>What to expect from us:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Our goal is to help your children grow in the sport of gymnastics in the most loving and nurturing way. Gymnastics is the basis for so many sports. </li>
                <li>Our goal is to teach you children with respect and encouragement. We want to empower your children, not only in gymnastics but in every aspect of their life, whether they take their knowledge of gymnastics to new sports or continue on the gymnastics path.</li>
                <li>We want you children to have fun in class. We want them to reach for their goals and it is our responsibility to do our best to get them there. We strive for good behavior and respect in the classroom.                 </li>
                <li>If school in Pella has a 2 hour delay due to winter weather, we will not have morning classes.                </li>
                <li>If school in Pella is cancelled or dismissed early due to winter weather, we will not have evening classes                 </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can contact us at pellabjj@gmail.com. Follow our Facebook and instagram @doubledutchgymnastics. Announcements will mostly be through Facebook and email!</p>
        
            <strong>What we expect from you:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Please make your payments promptly. The easiest way to make payments is through jackrabbit parent portal. You are also welcome to drop checks or cash off to Coach Attie. You are required to have a jackrabbit account wether or not you intend to pay through the portal.                 </li>
                <li>Monthly fees will be due the first class period of each month. 
                </li>
                <li>We will start promptly at the scheduled time. Please show up no more then 10 minutes early and no later then class time. 
                </li>
                <li>We run back to back classes so coaches will not have time to answer questions between classes, please email us at pellabjj@gmail.com with any questions or concerns. 
                </li>
                <li>Please set up a face to face meeting to share with us your concerns and reserve texting and emailing for schedule changes, payments, or other easy question. We want to maintain respect in our conversations and make sure that there are not misunderstandings that could have been avoided by face to face contact. You may direct concerns to Attie always. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>What we expect from students:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We will teach your student to have an “I can do all things” attitude. We hope that this reinforces the behaviors you teach at home.</li>
                <li> Please encourage your children to come to class with positive attitudes. We will also encourage them to lift each other up in the sport of gymnastics.</li>
                <li> In the gym there will be no gossip, whispering or cliques! We will always work to have positive things to say to each other. Setting a good example to those who are around you! You never know who is watching and repeating behaviors.  
                </li>
                <li>There will be NO CELL PHONES or cell phone use by students during class.</li>
                <li>Always have a positive word for those around you. Unkind words or actions towards staff or other students will not be tolerated and may result in dismissal from class both temporarily or permanently. </li>
            </ul>
