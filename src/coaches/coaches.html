                My love for gymnastics started at seven years old, I was determined to teach myself with the help from an amazing neighbor. The greatest gift for my 9th birthday was my mom signing me up for a gymnastics class and I was hooked! 



I was a gymnast until 17 when I discovered my love for teaching others gymnastics. I’ve never looked back, teaching others gymnastics quickly became my passion. 



Teaching came pretty natural, I’ve always enjoyed being the 3rd of eight children who also homeschooled. So teaching others has also been an important part of my life as long as I can remember. 



I started as a Junior Coach at 12 years old helping as many classes as I could. At 16, I became a coach of our competition team. 



At 18, I took on head coaching responsibilities for our competition team, including teaching routines, cleaning routines, travel, and being their cheerleader for every win or loss which was a valuable learning experience.



I’ve taught all ages from 18 months to 18 years both girls and boys. I’ve also done  cheer clinics and love working with Cheerleaders to help improve flexibility, stunts and more. 



I find that teaching little gymnasts self confidence and that hard work, practice and discipline will help them develop the skills necessary for any challenge they face as they become young adults. Watching their confidence, work ethic and skills grow is what makes me love teaching gymnastics more and more everyday. I can’t wait to teach and develop your little gymnast at Double Dutch Gymnastics!
